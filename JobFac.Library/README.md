## JobFac.Library

A general-purpose library package. The primary content is in the `JobFac.Library.DataModels` namespace, which defines the core POCO data models for the system including:

* job definitions and job-type-specific properties
* step definitions for sequence-type jobs
* job status
* job factory job-start opions

Enums used by the model classes are also defined here, along with system-wide constants such as configuration key-names. There are also a few extensions, formatting utilities, and so on.
