## JobFac.lib

A general-purpose library package. The primary content is in the `JobFac.lib.DataModels` namespace, which defines the core POCO data models for the system including:

* `JobDefinition`
* `SequenceDefinition`
* `StepDefinition`
* `JobStatus`
* `SequenceStatus`
* `FactoryStartOptions`

Enums used by the model classes are also defined here, along with system-wide constants such as configuration key-names. There are also a few extensions.
